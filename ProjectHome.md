## DOM Snitch ##
DOM Snitch is an experimental Chrome extension that enables developers and testers to identify insecure practices commonly found in client-side code. Key features:
  * **Real-time:** Developers and testers can observe DOM modifications as they happen inside the browser without the need to step through JavaScript code with a debugger or pause the execution of their application.

  * **Easy to use:** With built-in security heuristics and nested view, both advanced and less experienced developers and testers can quickly spot areas of the application being tested that need more attention.

  * **Easier collaboration:** Enables developers and testers to easily export and share captured DOM modifications while troubleshooting an issue with their peers.
